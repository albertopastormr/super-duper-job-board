# Contributing
This is a pretty relaxed project, and I'm open to any new interpretations and additions to the MVP, described below. Take a look at some issues I've created, or create new ones and tag me. Pretty simple? Great!

## Pull Requests
When contributing, create a feature branch off of **develop** with some identifyer to the issue you are working on. Create the pull request against the **develop** branch. You can either assign me to the PR or comment in the issue (both would be ideal).
