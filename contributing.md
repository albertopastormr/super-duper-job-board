# Contributing
This is a pretty relaxed project, and I'm open to any new interpretations and additions to the MVP, described below. Take a look at some [issues](https://github.com/ascasson/super-duper-job-board/issues) I've created, or create new ones and tag me. Pretty simple? Great!

## Pull Requests
When contributing, fork the repository and create a feature branch off of **develop** with some identifyer to the issue you are working on. Create the pull request against the **develop** branch upstream (the sourced repo). Comment in the issue to get my attention.
