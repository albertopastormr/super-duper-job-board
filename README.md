<h1 style="color:#876aa8;">Super Duper Job Board</h1>

<h2>What the heck is this?</h2>
Basically, the idea behind this stems from my partner needing a way for her to show available jobs in her industry. These jobs would ultimately be created by people/companies who have open positions. It's pretty similar to Craigslist, but in this case entries would need to be approved and paid for, which would also require some integration with a payment system.

        This is a pretty relaxed project, and I'm open to any new interpretations and additions to the MVP, described below. Take a look at some issues I've created, or create new ones and tag me. Pretty simple? Great!
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, be respectful of others. I have no problems reporting abuse that might appear in the form of disrespectful comments towards myself and others. This is a welcoming environment, and we should all collaborate appropriately. Just have fun!

    <p>
        The project's minimimum viable product should be pretty simple. We won't worry about persistent storage solutions and any other backend service components. This will, for the time being, be a frontend React-based endeavor. Here are some <b>basic feature goals</b>:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>General header in which anyone can incorporate their own image/messaging</li>
        <li>General footer in which anyone can incorporate their own image/messaging</li>
        <li>Interface that displays job postings provided by hard-coded or api-sourced data</li>
        <li>Interface that enables users to create job postings</li>
    </ul>
</div>
